# Super-parallel low-resource project

We develop computational methods for annotation projection in super parallel corpora of >1000 languages.
In our framework, called SuperPivot the over markings are the annotations label (we do not need costly manual annotation).

The first publication of this project is presented at EMNLP 2017 and the extended version is avaiable on arxiv.

This work has been highlighted by MIT Tech Review Magazine as well.
