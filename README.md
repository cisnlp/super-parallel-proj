# Super-parallel low-resource project

We develop computational methods for annotation projection in super parallel corpora of >1000 languages.
In our framework, called SuperPivot the over markings are the annotations label (we do not need costly manual annotation).

## Past, Present, Future: A Computational Investigation of the Typology of Tense in 1000 Languages

The first publication of this project is presented at EMNLP 2017 and the extended version is avaiable on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08914).

This work has been highlighted by [MIT Tech Review Magazine] (https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607825/new-software-program-translates-thousands-of-rare-languages/) as well.
